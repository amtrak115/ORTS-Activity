THE YEAR IS 1985.  THE YORK CANYON MINE HAS BECOME A MAJOR PRODUCER OF HIGH GRADE COAL BEING USED AT SEVERAL POWER PLANTS IN THE MIDWEST.  YOUR JOB IS TO HOOK UP 112 CARS OF LOADED COAL AND MOVE THE TRAIN DOWN THE MOUNTAIN TO THE MAINLINE AND THEN MOVE YOUR TRAIN EAST BOUND TO THE PASSING SIDING AT RATON.

YOUR JOB TODAY IS TO GET 112 COAL CARS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AND UP TO RATON PASSING SIDING.  YOU HAVE SIX C40-8 ENGINES FOR POWER AND YOU WILL HAVE TO PUT THREE ON THE POINT AND THREE AS MID TRAIN HELPERS. 

 IT IS SUGGESTED TO DROP OFF THE MID TRAIN HELPERS CONNECTED TO THE 38 CARS ON LOADING TRACK 1 (ON THE LEFT BACKING INTO YARD), THEN CONNECT WITH THE 36 CARS ON TRACK 3 (ON THE RIGHT), THEN CONNECT WITH THE 38 CARS ON TRACK 2 (MIDDLE).  YOU CAN THEN SPLIT THOSE CARS WITH 20 CARS ON THE FIRST HALF AND 18 ON THE LAST HALF OF THE TRAIN.  YOU ARE CLEAR TO LEAVE AS SOON AS YOUR TRAIN IS ASSEMBLED.

ALL SWITCHING AT THE YORK CANYON MINE IS MANUAL.  AT RATON, YOU WILL BE ROUTED ON TO THE RATON PASSING SIDING  WHERE YOU WILL STOP AT THE SWITCH THAT JOINS THE SIDING WITH THE NORTH YARD LEAD TRACK--THREE ENGINE LENGTHS PASS THE MP 659 MARKER.  THE REAR OF YOUR TRAIN SHOULD ALSO BE ON THE PASSING SIDING TRACK AND NOT OUT ON THE MAINLINE.

PART 2

YOUR JOB TODAY IS TO GET 112 COAL CARS OVER RATON PASS.  IT WILL TAKE YOU TWO TRIPS ACROSS THE PASS EACH TIME PULLING 56 CARS.  YOU WILL HAVE TO USE ALL SIX  C40-8W ENGINES JUST TO PULL 56 CARS UP THE PASS.  YOU ARE CLEARED TO MOVE YOUR TRAIN OVER RATON PASS.

AS YOU PULL OUT FROM THE RATON PASSING, DROP OFF THE LAST 56 CARS AT THE MP 659 SIGNPOST.  YOU WILL THEN CROSS OVER THE PASS WITH THE FIRST 56 CARS WHERE YOU WILL BE SWITCHED INTO THE JANSEN YARD.  YOU MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO DROP OFF THE HELPERS SO THAT YOU CAN RECONNECT WITH THEM TO GO BACK OVER THE PASS AND PICK UP THE SECOND SECTION.  WHEN YOU DROP OFF THE 56 CARS ON YARD TRACK 1 (ON YOUR LEFT BACKING IN) YOU WILL REVERSE YOUR PATH AND WHEN YOU PULL OUT OF THE YARD ON TO THE NORTH MAINLINE TRACK IT WILL BE REVERSED AGAIN ALLOWING YOU TO BACK OVER THE PASS.

COUPLE UP WITH THE LAST 56 CARS AND TAKE THEM OVER THE PASS USING ALL SIX ENGINES ON THE POINT YOU WILL RECOUPLE WITH THE CARS ON TRACK 1 ONLY THIS TIME YOU WILL HAVE ALL MANUAL SWITCHING INTO JANSEN YARD.  BE SURE TO RELOCATE YOUR ENGINES INTO POINT AND MIDTRAIN HELPERS.

WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR TRAIN REASSEMBLED MOVE DOWN TO THE TRINIDAD STATION AND STOP THERE FOR A CREW CHANGE--THIS CREW WILL HAVE USED UP ITS HOURS!  GOOD LUCK.

NOTICE:  IF YOU PLAN TO REARRANGE YOUR MIDHELPERS AT RATON IT MUST BE DONE USING THE MAINLINE TRACK AND NOT THE YARD LEAD.  THE SIGNALS PREVENT USING THE YARD LEAD..
