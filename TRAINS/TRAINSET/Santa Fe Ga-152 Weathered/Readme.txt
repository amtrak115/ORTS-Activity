Original Textures by Matt Doti and Alan Hudson


Introduction and Features:
**************************

The Ga-152 model was created by Matt Doti using Train Sim Modeler and Paint Shop Pro 8.  It is his first model and quite a fantastic one at that.  For the trucks and couplers he used Ted Curphey’s outstanding shapes.  Ted has been an invaluable asset for sharing his work with other's.

The original base textures were done by Mr. Doti.  I did 3D lighting effects and so on for the original cars and the loose weathering that these cars feature. 

The custom and prototypical physics are compliments of Dan Zollner.  
Beta testers for the original project included Herb Kelsey, John Reagon, as well as myself.  
These guys were a big help in the Ga-152 project.

Included with this set are a total of six gondolas, consisting of one loaded and one empty for each of the three paint schemes.

The yellow and black cars (numbers 74802 and 74987) are suitable for 1966 to the late 1970’s.  
The all black cars (numbers 74926 and 74971) are suitable for the early 1980’s.  
The black and orange cars (numbers 74945 and 74999) are suitable from the mid 1980’s to the present.  
Note, gondola #74945 is technically listed as loaded although the load is only a few scrap ties.



How To Use:
***********

Download the file and copy and paste the folder named, Santa Fe Ga-152 to your train sim trainset folder located at:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET

Mr. Doti incorporated aggressive levels of detail to help with frames per second.  However, because these cars use highly detailed trucks and couplers, he recommends not running more than 40 cars per train if you have an older computer.

Prototype Information:
**********************

The Santa Fe Ga-152 gondolas were constructed in 1966 by the Transco Rail Car company.  
These gondolas were specifically built for the Kaiser unit coal trains that traveled from the York Canyon mine in New Mexico to the Kaiser steel plant in Fontana California.  
Below is an excerpt from the Santa Fe Historical and Modeling Societies magazine, The Warbonnet Second Quarter 2004.

“September 28, 1967 … marked the beginning of regular service of the Santa Fe’s new unit-train operating over the 1,082 miles between the mine and Kaiser’s plant at Fontana.  
This train would carry 8,400 tons of coal from the mine to the mill and return covering the 2,164-mile round trip every four days – the longest precision scheduled unit train in the nation moving over a single railroad, and the first unit-train operating in the West.  
To provide this service, Santa Fe had acquired 101 specially-designed, black and yellow 100-ton gondola cars, costing $1.5 million, and 11 new diesel locomotives at a cost of $2 million.”

The unit train consisted of 84 gondolas and typically 9 locomotives.  
The Santa Fe successfully implemented Locotrol remote controlled helpers on this train.  
The motive power in the early years typically included Alco RSD15’s and EMD SD24’s, SD26’s, and SD39’s.  
As the years progressed so too did the locomotives that pulled this train.  
For suitable MSTS locomotives, I would suggest the Santa Fe SD24 by 3DTrains, as well as the “low nose” Santa Fe Alco RSD15 by Great North Rails.

The EMD SD24 can be found here:

The Ga-152 gondolas did not have hatches on the bottom of the car and could only be unloaded via a rotary dumper.  
Although the cars were modern for their time, the large outside bracing ribs made for very poor aerodynamics.  
In fact, these gondolas still hold the record for least fuel efficient car in the entire Santa Fe fleet

The as delivered yellow and black paint scheme changed in the early 1980’s to a much simplified all black scheme.  
Around this same time, the Kaiser steel mill in Fontana closed down.  
It was inevitable that, in the already smoggy Los Angeles region, burning this much coal for a steel mill would have to end at some point.

With the end of dedicated coal service, the Ga-152 cars were put to use as needed.  
The short lived all black paint scheme was altered again to the present day orange and black some time in the mid to late 1980’s.  
The surviving cars are currently used by the BNSF mainly in work train service hauling wooden ties.

I hope that you enjoy these freight cars.  This project wouldn't be possible without all of the wonderful guys who put time and effort into these cars.  

Ship and Travel Santa Fe All the Way!
