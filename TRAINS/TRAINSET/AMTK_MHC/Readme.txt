Overview
--------

This is a set of Material Handling Cars used by Amtrak to carry baggage and express mail on long-distance trains. There are two types included, the MHC I and MHC II series, with 9 individual car numbers for each. This has been accomplished using FreightAnim shapes to add the lettering while using a common main shape to keep file size to a minimum.


Notes
-----

Some of the cars in this pack have been depicted as configured from the late 1980s to early 1990s, while others are correct from the mid 1990s until retirement around 2003. To ensure correct use of the cars in your consists, please consult this list of the appropriate car numbers:

Prototype
---------

The models and textures in this pack represent two series of Material Handling Cars built by Thrall in 1986 (MHC I) and 1988 (MHC II) for express service on Amtrak. The MHC I cars rode on traded-in BX express reefer trucks, while the MHC II cars had GSI Commonwealth passenger-style trucks. Both groups of cars received door locking wheels and side ladders in the early 1990s as a modernization.

From the late 1980s until just a few years ago, MHCs were a fixture on many of Amtrak's routes, with some trains carrying as many as six of them. Because they were wired for Head-End Power (HEP) pass-through, they were often found at the front of a consist, directly behind the engines, but could also be seen on the rear of many trains.

All of the MHCs were withdrawn from service around the year 2003 when Amtrak elected to discontinue express-mail handling on long-distance routes.
