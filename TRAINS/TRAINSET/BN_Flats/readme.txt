MSTS 12 different BN Flatcars with Loads

A set of a dozen Burlington Northern flatcars in 3 styles with a variety of loads. Cars come in plain, bulkhead (2 styles), log bunks, log loads, blue tarped loads, white tarped loads, aluminum ingot loads. The cars average around 1500 polys and are photo realistic. This set is sure to spice up activities, and even small enough to be included with activities. This is the first of two planned sets of BN flatcars.
