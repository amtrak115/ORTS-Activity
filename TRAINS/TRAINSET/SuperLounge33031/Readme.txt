Superliner II Sightseer Lounge #33031 - Amtrak Ph. IV Paint
---------------------------------

v1.0, July 10th, 2001
For use with Microsoft Train Simulator.
Modified from the default by Buzz Benz

Please turn Word Wrap ON!

Thank you for downoading this car!  This is installment #6 from what i am referring to as the Empire Builder Series.  This series of cars are re-worked Textures that make use of the  default MSTS Superliner Car model.

These are the modifications I have done to this car:
- Darkened the stripes to more closely represent the Amtrak prototype.
- Re-worked the corrugation texture to make it look cleaner and more believable.
- Added the small white bars (which in real life are reflective stripes) at the bottom of each car.
- Shrunk the roof windows a bit from the default to closer match the prototype.


Installation
------------
1.  Create a new folder in the "Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset" folder called "SuperLounge33031".

2.  Unzip "S2LNGA41.zip" into the Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset\SuperLounge33031 folder.

That's it!
Why can't you name the folder whatever you want?  The reason has to do with consists.  If there is an acitivity that uses these cars in a consist,  in order for that consist to work properly, ALL the cars used MUST be present and in a folder named exactly what it was when the consist was created.


Known Issues
------------
None (when installed as instructed), except the texture mapping keeps the car from looking completely accurate.


Legal Stuff
-----------

I am including with these cars the .tga files used to create the .ace files.  You are free to modify and distribute these files PROVIDED THAT they are NOT included in any package where money is to be made.  It may be packaged in a CD provided that any charge for the CD is ONLY to recover the cost and shipping of the CD.  In addition, it must be made clear to the purchaser of the CD that these files can be downloaded for free from the Internet.  Basically you can distribute them as long as no profit is gained.  Hey, i don't care about the credit, i do care that they remain free.

I'm interested to know if anyone would like to see these cars in the Amtrak Phase III scheme as well.  That is probably the paint scheme Amtrak is most known by (equal sized Red, White, and Blue Stripes).  Believe me, i'd love to make them, just want to know if anyone wants them as well!

Thanks again for downloading, and happy railroading!
