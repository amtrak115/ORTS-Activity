Description:
---------------------------------------------
The CF7 History: In Early 1970, the Santa Fe shops in Cleburne, Texas, began what is probably the most ambitious locomotive rebuild program by any United States railroad.  They stripped off the shell of  F3, F7 and F9 cab units, rebuilt the frame and converted what was to finally total 233 covered wagons into hood units.  This program extended the lifetime of these units to as much as a half-century. 

This model was made using TrainSim Modeler from Abacus.
The release include two liveries: Santa Fe -Originally F3 22C, CF7 2626 
and Nacionales de Mexico number 6330.
   Included two undecorated versions- Angled cab and Rounded Cab for those people with re-painting skills I suggest you use these versions instead of of the painted-ready.
  Also I strongly suggest if you can, use the cabview and sound folders from the 3DT_F7A_DEMO train.

To install:
---------------------------------------------
Cabview and Sound are indexed so this new Locomotive is ready to use. you can install it in several forms doing the following:

1) Extract the zip file under...
   \Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET   or
   \Archivos de programa\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET
   or the name of the folder that you use. 
   (Program Files or Archivos de programa for example) 
   then a folder "CF7-    (*)     " is created inside of TRAINSET folder.


                                   or

2)You can Unzip the entire contents of this zip file into any temp folder and copy in the Trainset folder under the name "CF7-    (*)     " or any name you want.
      
                                   or

3)Create a folder named "CF7-    (*)    " inside "TRAINSET" folder,  and unzip there.
   

(*)the name depends on the file that is using: (ie: CF7-AngledCab or CF7-RoundedCab or CF7-SF or CF7-NdeM)

4)Copy the file CF7-RoundedCab.CON to your Consist folder.(now you have your first consist)

from now You can add new cars to your CF7- , using the
consist editor portion of the activity editor.
