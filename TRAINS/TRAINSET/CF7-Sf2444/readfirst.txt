MSTS CF7 Santa Fe 2444
repaint of Manuel Sanabria's angled cab CF7. Thanks to Manuel for his excellent model, and the inclusion of user friendly repaint templates, making this version possible.

This livery was created after photo's I have found on various train enthousiast sites on the web, and I have tried to stay as close as possible to the original. I know the Santa Fe herald on the short nose is too large, but the texture that goes on the nose is only so big, and I had to strike a compromise between readability and accuracy.

I have changed the alpha channel on one of the .ace files to make a small extra window on the engineers front side, as most CF7's seem to have one.
Manuel's readme is also included for your information. (the org_readme file)
Cabview and sound are aliased to the default GP38, so that should be properly installed.

Instructions:
Unzip this zip file to a temporary directory.

Use explorer to move the CF7_Sf2444 folder to the 'Trainset' folder in your Trainsim installation.

Use the consist editor portion of the Trainsimulator activity editor to create a consist.

Start Trainsim itself, select your consist, and off you go!

Enjoy the ride.



The use of these files should not harm your computer, but if you think it did, do not blame me O.K.?

And another thing, as is Manuel's original file, this repainted version is intended as freeware, so do not try to make money with these files in anyway!


Greetings and happy railroading,
