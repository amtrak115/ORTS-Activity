MSTS Santa Fe CF7 texture update.
This file contains replacement texture files only, for the complete locomotive model my repaint of Manuel Sanabria`s angled cab CF7 model is required. It is available in the Train-sim.com library as sf2444.zip.

Included in this zip file:
readme text file (you are reading it now)
file_id.diz  (for use in the train-sim.com library, may discarded)
sf2444up.gif  (for use in the train-sim.com library, may discarded)
sf2444up.jpg  (larger version of the previous, a picture of the locomotive, for preview purposes)
CF7-tga.ace
CF7-tga2.ace  (the new texture files)

What to do?
- unzip the sf2444up.zip in a temporary folder.
- use explorer, and find the sf2444 folder in the trainset folder of your trainsimulator installation.
- make backups of the CF7-tga.ace and CF7-tga2.ace files that are in there, and keep them in a safe place.
- move the texture files in this zip with the same names to the sf2444 folder. (Answer 'yes' to the overwrite question only if you have made backups of the files)
- close explorer, start trainsimulator, select a consist with the CF7 sf2444 in it, and look at the results.

What has changed?
The Santa Fe lettering on the sides and nose is in a more accurate letter type, close to the original.
The 'circle and cross' logo is redrawn, now better looking with less 'jaggies'.
The windows are outlined in black, simulating the rubber gaskets.
The alpha channel was fine tuned for better looking, slightly tinted windows.
Window wipers were added to the front windows, however they are 'painted on' only, and as such not functional with the 'V' key.
