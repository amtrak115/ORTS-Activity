MSTS Santa Fe angled cab CF7 texture update
An update of the textures of my repaint of Manuel Sanabria's angled cab CF7 model.
Includes accurate Santa Fe lettering on sides and nose. More realistic 'circle and cross' logo on the nose.
Fine tuned alpha channel for better looking, tinted windows with (non-functional) wipers.
