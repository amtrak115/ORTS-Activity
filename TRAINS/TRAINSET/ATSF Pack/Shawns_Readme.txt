MSTS Chicago & North Western 86' Pullman Standard Auto Parts Boxcars

Description:
This 86' PS Auto Parts boxcar is a new model built in TSM. It used Ted Curpheys Boxcar ace file that was repainted and reskinned into CNW paint, and includeds his trucks and couplers. The couplers of the set where redesigned to best match the couplers on the drawing. Also included is a air hose that goes from one end to the other underneath the frame. This connects the air hoses that would normally just float there. Sills where also put in place underneath the frame, it's best to try and have it a slightly diffrent shade then the rest of the colors. When changing the CasCroSndAlias files, please copy/paste or cut/paste into the original folder copying over the original files.
