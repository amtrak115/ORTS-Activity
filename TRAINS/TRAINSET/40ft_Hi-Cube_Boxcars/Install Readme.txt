Photoskins by Bernard Grant [Burgerbern}
a special mention to Skip for all of the hard work sourcing the photograph's used, they are very rare and hard to find.

for those wondering about the lack of SP wagons, these are going to be made on a special shape file in a future project
by David Rowe. they will be announced when he is ready but will be a while into the future. Please do not bother him about
them, all good things come to those that wait, i only mentioned this to stop people asking me why i avoided doing any SP
wagons in this set.
