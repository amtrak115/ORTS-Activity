This is an 89' KTTX flat car with 3 versions for creating realistic TOFC trains. There is an empty car, one with a single trailer, and one with two trailers. The cars have the following features:

- Accurate weight info based on data from the TTX site and assuming a 50,000 lb trailer .
- .s file includes the latest mipmapping fix introduced by Chrisell.
- .wag file includes coupler break fix. 

Unzip the .s, .sd, .wag, and .tga files to the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Train Simulator\TRAINS\TRAINSET folder, the proper new folder for the cars will be created during unzipping (KTTX89flat). To use the cars in the Sim, you will need to create a consist for them in the Activity editor. You can find information on using the activity editor in the Help files that come with the sim or by visiting this page at the train-sim.com site:  http://www.train-sim.com/cgi/kds?8zAWq01i=main/consist.htm

Two TGA files are included for repainting purposes, one 256 x 256 texture for the flat car itself, and a 512 x 512 texture for the van. The van texture is generic and ready for the addition of new roadnames.

Due to the relatively high poly count and texture size, particularly for the 2 van version, the cars can cause performance hits when used in quantity. The conv3ds utility will not accept muliple LOD's as described in the Docs, so unfortunately the full detail model is used throughout a train. I have included a 256 x 256 texture for the van to replace the 512 x 512, this may help people with older video cards. It's named ttxvan.256, but if you rename it ttxvan.ace and copy it to your KTTX89flat folder, you will be using the lower res texture.
