For use with Microsoft Train Simulator.
Modifications by Buzz Benz
Reworked into a Transition Sleeper from Andrew Held's Superliner Coach.  Thanks Andrew!

Please turn Word Wrap ON!

Thank you for downoading this car!  This is installment #4 from what i am referring to as the Empire Builder Series.  This series of cars are re-worked Textures that make use of the  default MSTS Superliner Car model.

The majority of the cars in this series are modified from Andrew Held's Superliner Coach, the exception being the Sightseer Lounge which is modified directly from the default by myself (Buzz).

What makes these cars different?  Here are the modifications:
- Darkened the stripes to more closely represent the Amtrak prototype.
- Re-worked the corrugation texture to make it look cleaner and more believable.
- Added the small white bars (which in real life are reflective stripes) at the bottom of each car.
- Tinted the windows and added the center bar on all cars worked from Andrew Held's Coach.
- Shrunk the roof windows a bit on the Lounge Cafe from the default to closer match the prototype.
- Changed the texture for the trucks on the Coach Smoking and Coach Baggage car to match Superliner I    style.
- Placed all windows as best i could given the way MS maps the texture to the model.


Installation
------------
1.  Create a new folder in the "Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset" folder called "SuperTrans39018".

2.  Unzip "S2TRSA41.zip" into the Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset\SuperTrans39018 folder.

That's it!
Why can't you name the folder whatever you want?  The reason has to do with consists.  If there is an acitivity that uses these cars in a consist,  in order for that consist to work properly, ALL the cars used MUST be present and in a folder named exactly what it was when the consist was created.


Known Issues
------------
None (when installed as instructed), except the texture mapping keeps the car from looking completely accurate.  This car is the extreme case, as the MSTS model has the end doors all on the lower level anyway (which makes this car kind of useless, except that it wouldn't be a protoypical Amtrak Train without one).  Neither side of the car is completely accurate, so i had to compromise.  Thus, this car may not be 100% true-to-life, but it does have the overall "feel" of the real thing, and it does look nice at the head of the train.


Legal Stuff
-----------

I am including with these cars the .tga files used to create the .ace files.  You are free to modify and distribute these files PROVIDED THAT they are NOT included in any package where money is to be made.  Basically you can distribute them as long as they remain free.  Hey, i don't care about the credit, i do care that they remain free.


Other Stuff

Many thanks to Andrew Held for his Superliner Coach and his kindness in sharing his work with the world!
It's guys like him that will make this hobby as enjoyable as can be!  Thanks again Andrew!
