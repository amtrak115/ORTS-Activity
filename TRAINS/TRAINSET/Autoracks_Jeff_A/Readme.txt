MSTS Fix for all three Autorack packs for those not using Anisotropic filtering

This pack contains all 60 shape files for the three Autorack packs optimised for use
on systems where anisotropic Filtering is either turned off or the hardware cannot handle it.

just replace the existing shape file with these

if you can and the machine is able for best results with either the original shapes or these ones 
use 8x setting for Anisotropic Filtering as well as anti Aliasing.

This pack is freeware and not to be used for commercial purposes under any circumstances.
