Installation notes for the: "100 ton Coal"

1) Copy the folder that was created by WinZip into your 
   "Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset\" folder. 

2) Open the Activity Editor and create a new Consist and 
   enjoy your new coal car.  

There are two versions of this car. One is empty and the other is fully 
loaded.  This way you can mix and match your consists. Each car has had 
a proper weight entered into the wag file.  So a consist of empties will 
be completely different from a consist of loaded cars.


***********************************************************************
Repainting information:  

The included BMP file includes both sides and ends of the car. This was 
done to facilitate the repainting of non symetrical schemes such as 
those cars that mark the rotary end the car with a different color (PP&L
does this in my area). The leftmost view of the end is mapped to the 
brake end of the car. The rectangle of color under each end image is 
used on the surfaces on that end of the car such as ladders and 
supports. I can't promise that every scheme will paint perfectly, but it 
should be good enough for most uses. One last note, the coupler color is 
the rectangle to the right of the brakewheel, couplers are left 
unpainted, so be sure to avoid that section if you are doing a 
complete recolor of the entire car.
