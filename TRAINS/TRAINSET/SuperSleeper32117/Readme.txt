Reworked into a Sleeping Car from Andrew Held's Superliner Coach.  Thanks Andrew!

Please turn Word Wrap ON!

Thank you for downoading this car!  This is installment #1 from what i am referring to as the Empire Builder Series.  This series of cars are re-worked Textures that make use of the  default MSTS Superliner Car model.

The majority of the cars in this series are modified from Andrew Held's Superliner Coach, the exception being the Sightseer Lounge which is modified directly from the default by myself (Buzz).

Why do i call this the Empire Builder Series?  Simple - I have an activity i am working on called the Empire Builder.  There will be two of these, one eastbound and one westbound, and these activities will be to follow Amtrak's actual timetable for the Empire Builder all the way from Whitefish to Shelby and Vice Versa.

Thus, these cars are the Empire Builder Series as these are the cars i am using for the train!

What makes them different?  Here are the modifications:
- Darkened the stripes to more closely represent the Amtrak prototype.
- Re-worked the corrugation texture to make it look cleaner and more believable.
- Added the small white bars (which in real life are reflective stripes) at the bottom of each car.
- Tinted the windows and added the center bar on all cars worked from Andrew Held's Coach.
- Shrunk the roof windows a bit on the Lounge Cafe from the default to closer match the prototype.
- Changed the texture for the trucks on the Coach Smoking and Coach Baggage car to match Superliner I    style.
- Placed all windows as best i could given the way MS maps the texture to the model.


Installation
------------
1.  Create a new folder in the "Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset" folder called "SuperSleeper32117".

2.  Unzip "S2SLPA41.zip" into the Train Simulator\Trains\Trainset\SuperSleeper32117 folder.

That's it!
Why do you need to name the folder what i say to?  The reason has to do with consists.  Once i upload the Empire Builder Activities, they will require the whole Empire Builder Series of Superliner cars.  The activity will use a consist called "Empire Builder".  In order for the consist to work properly, ALL the cars MUST be present and in a folder named exactly what it was when the consist was created.  As a result, i will only guarantee that these cars will work properly if they are installed where instructed.


Known Issues
------------
None (when istalled as instructed), except the texture mapping keeps the car from looking completely accurate.


Legal Stuff
-----------

I am including with these cars the .tga files used to create the .ace files.  You are free to modify and distribute these files PROVIDED THAT they are NOT included in any package where money is to be made.  Basically you can distribute them as long as they remain free.  Hey, i don't care about the credit, i do care that they remain free.


Other Stuff
