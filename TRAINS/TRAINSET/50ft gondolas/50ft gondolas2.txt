MSTS 50' Gondolas with various loads 6-pack

Original photos by George Elwood, Greg Dickinson, VG Aylward, Gary Overfield and Larry Berger and Jay Williams (courtesy of George Elwood).
The OSM texture is edited from 2 photos as the other had better quality but the company name was Cregon Eel nills...

The EL gondola needs to be between 2 flat cars, as it has oversize load.

Feel free to repaint these cars as long as I get the credit of the models. I can also supply the TSM file if you want to create new load.

Installation: extract this zip file to Trainsim/trains/trainset folder
