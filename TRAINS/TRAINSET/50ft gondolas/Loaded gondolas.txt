MSTS Gondolas with various loads 14-pack, version 1.1
Now with ~1000 polygons less in each car than in 1.0.

The OSM texture is edited from 2 photos as the other had better quality but the company name was Cregon Eel nills...
The loaded EL gondola needs to be between 2 flat cars, as it has oversize load.
It's now included also as an empty car. Both have now older friction bearing trucks.

All cars heave different shape files, except these are the same: DRGWgon_empty, OSMgon_empty and RMDXgon_empty. BNgon_empty rides few inches lower than the loaded version, and PLE and EJE2 are 56foot cars, others are 52ft. 

When repainting, I recommend to use RouteRiter to uncompress and compress the shape files, so you can change the names of the textures and put all cars to same folder.
 


Feel free to repaint these cars as long as I get the credit of the models. If you create multiple cars with similar name, please release the cars as a pack in one folder instead of separate cars. I can also supply the TSM file if you want to create new load.
